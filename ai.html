          <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I finished my Bachelor's in 2022 so ChatGPT was just getting launched. I think the first time I actually used a LLM it
            was for something unserious like generating a movie script. Fast forward to 2026 and I'm working on my master's degree while
            figuring out how do I even attack these tools that seem to get better overnight.

            I have a lot of thoughts, but at the end of the day, I don't want to trade off efficiency gained from AI tools for learning. 
            In school, I'm not only giving up wages to be here but I'm paying to be here, so I would only be robbing myself if I let Claude earn my
            degree for me. It is tempeting because of efficiency, but I do believe there is a way to strike a balance. For topics and areas that I am 
            already comfortable with (ie making a map of US Census Data), I don't mind using AI since I have a prior in regards to what the output should look like
            and what's reasonable. For topics that are new to me, I want to be doing the work myself and using AI as a guide or tutor when I get stuck. I think this is the best way to learn and also be efficient.
          </p>

          <h2>Tools & Workflows</h2>
          <p>
            I mainly use Claude but have considered switching to Codex. Since I'm broke and in grad school, my balance is:
            First: use my student version of Gemini for basic reasoning tasks, make outlines, audit code etc.
            Second: when I need to build I use Claude since (for now, I'm paying for it)

            I have been trying to populate my portfolio while also managing the academic program so I developed two approaches to using AI in my projects:
            1. For portfolio projects, I use AI as a tool to help me be more efficient. I will use it to generate code snippets, debug, and even write documentation. 
            Risk: It can be easy to mass produce AI slop with way if my goal is just to have more projects.
            Reward: I barely knew java before this and now I am able to design front end applications with AI tools. Also this is a chacne
            to show that I am embracing smart ways to use AI.

            2. For academic projects, I use AI as a tutor and to create study guides. I like Gemini learning mode and I will try and prompy any LLM I use for school
            to PLEASE NOT GIVE ME THE ANSWER, and walk me through problems in a dialouge. I'm studying a very technical masters to most LLM are pretty capable of getting into
            basic concepts of stuff like machine learinig, econometrics, etc. 
            I like to feed it my class slides or previous assignments to make study guides. I found this to be really helpful and it has its own process:
            1. I feed it materials and have it make me a latex template for a student guide. Generally I prompt it to do free response questions, and do my first pass as an
            overview of key concepts or therories. I only sometimes ask it for proofs as most of my courses don't ask for this.
            2. I put this in Overleaf and do the study guide by hand. Even if I don't know at all the answer, I shoot in the dark. Just something. I've found
            this process helps things stick and breaks my temptation to just ask for the answer.
            3. I upload the final doc and ask it to score my responses. Sometimes I do terribly and that is OK. I ask it to first just score and mark which questions got wrong - but DON'T explain why. 
            4. Then I look at the questions I got wrong and use AI learning mode to get the right answers.
          </p>

          <h2>Ethics & Academic Integrity</h2>
          <p>
            I'm still working on the best workflow for this but I think the key is to be transparent with professors and employers about how I use AI. 
            I want to be clear that I'm not using it to do the work for me, but rather as a tool to help me learn and be more efficient. I also want to make sure that I'm not violating any academic integrity policies, so I always check with my professors before using AI for any assignments or projects.
